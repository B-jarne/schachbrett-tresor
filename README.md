# schachbrett-tresor

This project was made for a class at Uni Oldenburg.

Its purpose is to use multiple Hall-sensors, which we put under a chess board, to detect whether a chess piece is standing on a specific field. 
The code can make the distinction between different kinds of magnets, which we used to check for the piece's color.

The other part of the code is used to connect the microcontroller with wifi and then use that connection to send the current pattern of pieces on the board.
If that pattern is the right one, a signal is being sent to a servo motor that opens a safe.

This was a group project that was limited to one term, so it will probably not be improved in the future and it is not possible to contribute to it.
